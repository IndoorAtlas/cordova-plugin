# IndoorAtlas Cordova Plugin 1.3 with IndoorAtlas SDK 2.5

[IndoorAtlas](https://www.indooratlas.com/) provides a unique Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that runs a disruptive geomagnetic positioning in its full-stack hybrid technology for accurately pinpointing a location inside a building. The IndoorAtlas SDK enables app developers to use high-accuracy indoor positioning in venues that have been fingerprinted.

This Cordova plugin provides information about the device's location inside finger printed buildings and uses the [IndoorAtlas location APIs](http://docs.indooratlas.com/cordova/api-documentation). [Cordova Examples](https://github.com/IndoorAtlas/sdk-cordova-examples) are also available.

Getting started requires you to set up a free developer account and fingerprint your indoor venue using the [IndoorAtlas MapCreator 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indooratlas.android.apps.jaywalker).
